# Philosophy

## State

> Bunches O' Frameworks

While not all of frameworks have names,  
Each app has sets of patterns, tools, and practices.

These are important.  
They're represent the innovations of that app.

Teams need the autonomy to make decisions at the app level without consensus.  
This is good.

## Problem

> Failed at extension

The failing of Interfaces is that it lacks clear methods of extension.

At the time that it was extracted,  
We thought customization was enough: variables.

But, without guidance, app-side extensions of Interfaces made it impossible to work on without breaking other apps.  
This problem magnified by the platform-level integration of Topbar.

Apps needed framework level updates,  
Which made it hard to merge breaking style changes.

## Struggle

We've been steadily moving away from Interfaces by

- investing in app-side frameworks and solutions
- extrating icons, `topbar` and `url` functionality from the style lib
- blowing up Interfaces into individual selectors — to make removal easy
- adding `minions.css`, for avoiding abstractions altogether

## A Bright Spot

> @planningcenter/icons

Almost all teams are regularly committing to `icons` — from individual illustrations to SVG and build-step fixes.  
It's not perfect but it's a big success toward cross team collaboration.

### Takeaways

1. We prefer the safety of an application-specific sandbox
2. We are capable of managing the complexities of publishing and versioning npm packages
3. We want better first-class methods for extending and exploring

### What I'd Like to Take Further

The biggest failing of icons is that everything remains siloed.

We'd like to fix that by marking a clear path from app-specific code to shared-library code.

## Goal

> Guided Autonomy

To provide a path to a shared designer experience — where sharing is easier than not sharing.  
Do this using framework-agnostic web standards for the long-term agility of Planning Center.

## The vision

`Extensions`

We want to create a space that preserves autonomy but grants developers access to tooling.

### Host company-wide discussions to suss out standards

- Create spec
- Codify system values

### Opt-in Complexity

- Bootstrap-style 2-import install
- Copy-pastable, injectable, and extensible

### Standards First

- Support our platform yesterday, today, and tomarrow
- Allow extensability by other, platform-targeting stacks

### Pull requests welcome, not required
