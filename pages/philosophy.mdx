# Philosophy

## Goal

> Guided Autonomy

To provide a path to a shared designer experience — where sharing is easier than not sharing.  
Do this using framework-agnostic web standards for the long-term agility of Planning Center.

## A Bright Spot

> @planningcenter/icons

Almost all teams are regularly committing to `icons` — from individual illustrations to SVG and build-step fixes.

### Takeaways

1. Designers prefer the safety of an application-specific sandbox
2. Designers are very capable of managing the complexities of publishing and versioning npm packages

### What I'd Like to Take Further

The biggest failing of icons is that everything remains siloed.

I'd like to fix that by marking a clear path from app-specific code to shared-library code

## The Problem at Hand

Up to this point we've lived in two distant lands.  
On one side there is an authoritarian library, gatekeeping every PR.  
On the other side, Mad Max.

I want to open up a dialog in a third space.

## The vision

`Extensions`

I want to create a space that preserves autonomy but grants developers access to tooling.

### Opt-in Complexity (support all designers)

### Standards First (support all platforms)

### Copy-Paste Extensibility

### Monorepo Structure

### Generators and Generative Documentation
